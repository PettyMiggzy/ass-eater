# Persistent notes (business/product context, not code docs)

Read this at the start of a session for context that isn't obvious from the
code. Append to it -- don't let it go stale, but don't delete history that
might matter later either.

## Founder/creator token allocation

The platform owner will hold **40% of $ONLYASS's 1 billion total supply**,
unlocked over **30 days after deploy**, with a **daily cap on how much can be
collected/claimed** (exact vesting curve/cap not yet specified as of
2026-09-16). Relevant whenever touching:

- Public tokenomics disclosure/marketing copy for $ONLYASS -- a 40% founder
  allocation is the kind of thing that needs to be disclosed plainly, not
  discovered later, both for basic trust and because a large, presumably
  short-vested founder stake is exactly the pattern retail buyers get burned
  by when it isn't disclosed.
- Any future on-chain vesting/claim contract for this allocation -- nothing
  like that has been built yet. If asked to build it, the daily-cap +
  30-day-window mechanic needs the actual numbers first, not defaults guessed
  at.
- `treasury-hedge.ts` / price-impact modeling -- a wallet than can eventually
  move 40% of supply is a meaningful tail risk for pool depth/slippage
  assumptions once vesting completes.

**Decided (2026-09-16): no code/UI action needed on this right now.** The
allocation just sits unclaimed in the launch/deploy contract until the
30-day window is up -- deliberately not surfacing it on the site or in
marketing before then ("no reason to scare people right now" / "no reason to
jump the gun"). Once claimable, the plan is a **separate treasury wallet**
(not yet created) that the owner will withdraw into and use for marketing
spend. Don't build a vesting/claim contract or add any founder-allocation
UI/disclosure unless asked -- this is intentionally quiet until launch.

## Branding

**Decided (2026-09-16): no rename.** Considered changing the product name
while keeping the onlyass.fun domain (see rationale below, kept for
context), but concluded there's no clean way to do it and is keeping the
name as-is. Don't propose or build toward a rename unless the user brings it
back up.

Original reasoning, for context: explicit "Only Ass" branding is a real
problem for mainstream ad platforms (Google/Meta/TikTok Ads all prohibit
adult content ads regardless of brand name -- they review actual site
content, not just the name -- so a rename would mainly have helped with
stigma/press/App Store listing/word-of-mouth, not with unlocking those ad
platforms directly). Current plan either way: advertise primarily on adult
ad networks, since mainstream paid ads are blocked by the content itself.
